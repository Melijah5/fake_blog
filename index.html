        <p>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education
            at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable
            to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree. </p>

        <p> During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics
            at Prague, returning to Zurich in the following year to fill a similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin. He became a German citizen in 1914 and remained
            in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton*. He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post
            in 1945.</p>

        <p> World War II, Einstein was a leading figure in the World Government Movement, he was offered the Presidency of the State of Israel, which he declined, and he collaborated with Dr. Chaim Weizmann in establishing the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>Einstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination to solve them. He had a strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way to his goal. He regarded his major achievements as
            mere stepping-stones for the next advance.</p>

        <h1 style="color: red;">Top 10 Amazing life lessons from Albert Einstein</h1>
        <ol style="color: rgb(255, 217, 0);">
            <li>Follow your Curiosity</li>

            <p>As a theoretical physicist it was his job to be curious and to want to know and understand how the world works. A famous quote of Albert Einstein is: “I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.” He was so interested in life
                and everything around him that he couldn’t stop himself form learning about it and wanting to know everything. This is a very good quality to have if you want to succeed in any way. When you’re curious about something you are willing to
                put in the time and energy to learn about it.</p>
            <li>Perseverance is priceless</li>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a very simple man as you can tell by his earlier quote. He didn’t think he had any special gift but that his curiosity was his talent and that it helped him to learn as much as he did in his life. But being curious alone
                isn’t going to help you to succeed, it is also necessary that you won’t give up easily. You must be willing to keep going when things get tough on you. If you don’t succeed in the beginning you need to persevere and keep pushing until
                you get what you want. As Einstein said it: “It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.” Most people give up on things when they get a small setback. They think the world is against them or that they are simply
                not made to achieve whatever goal they’ve set. When you want to achieve anything in life you need to keep working towards your goals even when you’re having a hard time and it seems like your getting nowhere.
            </p>
            <li>Focus on the present</li>
            <p>Even though it is very important to have your goals set and to know what you want to achieve in life it is even more important to focus on the present. You can’t control how anything will be in the future other then by making changes in the
                present. These changes can and will effect how you future will look like. They will help you achieve your goals and get where you want to be, but it is important to be aware of your present behavior.
            </p>

            <li>The imagination is powerful</li>
            <p>The imagination of a human is unimaginably powerful. Your mind doesn’t know the difference between reality and imagination. That’s why it is so important to visualize your goals and dreams. The clearer the picture in your head about what you
                want to achieve is the easier it is to get there, simply because your mind will feel like it is already doing the things you’ll need to do when you really are achieving your goals.
            </p>

            <li>Make mistakes.</li>
            <p>To grow you must learn and to learn you must make mistakes. People are naturally afraid of making mistakes. They avoid being wrong at all costs. Although mistakes are important to be able to learn from them and grow. When you make a mistake
                you’ve tried something that didn’t work out. so now you know. Next time you know you shouldn’t try the exact same thing (that point is coming..), but you should adjust your approach and see if that does work.
            </p>

            <li>Live in the moment</li>
            <p> As you need to focus on the present as mentioned earlier because you can’t control the future, it is also key in life to really live in the moment. Take the time to appreciate the world around you. There is no need to worry about your past
                or be anxious about tomorrow, you have no influence about that. All you will get from worrying to much is a negative feeling while there are so many things directly around you to be grateful for.</p>

            <li>Create value.</li>
            <p>There is no greater feeling in the world then to be able to help anyone. You help them because you can create value for them in a way that they can’t do them self yet. By being able to add value to other peoples lives and the world you are
                becoming a better person. Focus on the things you love doing the most and get to the point where you’re the expert on the subject so you can add value to other people interested as well. It will help you grow even more when you can teach
                your knowledge to the world.</p>

            <li>Don't expect different results.</li>
            <p>At number 5 I mentioned how important it is to make mistakes for you to be able to learn and grow. The only key element there is that you don’t try to do the same thing again and again and expect to get different results. When you don’t change
                anything in your actions or approach you will most certainly get to exact same results as before. To learn and grow you need to be aware of what you can or must change in order to get a different outcome.
            </p>
            <li>Knowledge comes from experience</li>
            <p>Knowledge is gained through experience. You’ll get experience by trying and doing, learning what works and what not. Making mistakes and finding out why it was a mistake. Try it again with a slightly different approach and see how that goes.
                Still not working? Give it another try, again with a change in your actions. By following these actions you’ll eventually come to the point where your approach is the right solution. And now you know that for the next time, so you’ll be
                able to tackle the same issue the first time. You’ll even be at the point where you can use your knowledge, or experience, to help other by learning them about the mistakes you’ve made before you got to the right solution.</p>
            <li>Learn the rules and then play better</li>
            <p>In every game it is important to know the rules it is played by. Even in life there are a lot of rules you need to keep yourself to. But there are also a lot of rules that can be bend in your advantage. Take your chance to profit from the
                mazes in the rules and see where you can legally(!) go by them to get that advantage over others who don’t want to put in the time and energy to learn the rules of life.</p>
